More details are in Design.md, for project 2.

This is a webapp for textbook exchange at Calvin, to facilitate selling and buying of books between students.
It would include fields for textbook name, course, professor (optional), and price (optional).
Some people prefer to negotiate the price so they don't upload it which is fine.
It would also have information about the seller's name and contact information.
  - everyone would have to create an account to use this, either to sell or buy
  - additional feature would be to connect the user's profile to Facebook and automatically import the name and contact info.
