This is an updated vision statement and a preliminary design for your team project. The vision should be an updated version of your original proposal and should include a list the names of all team members; store this in the README.md for one of the team members, deleting the project directories for all other team members so that itâ€™s obvious where the main projects are. 

The design should specify the component structure for your ReactJS frontend and the document structure of your MongoDB backend; store this in DESIGN.md.
